# FIDAS SOP: Comprehensive Guide to Fabric Inspection and Defect Analysis

![Fabric Inspection Machine](/images/Capture.png)

## Introduction

Fabric mills should perform 100% inspection before sending any consignment to the apparel industry to minimize hassles. This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the key considerations, processes, and systems used in fabric inspection, with a focus on the widely-adopted Four Point System.

## Key Considerations for Fabric Inspection

### A. Inspection Environment and Equipment

1. **Area**: The inspection area should be dry, open, clean, and cool with sufficient light.
2. **Equipment**: Both garment makers and fabric mills should have high-quality inspection equipment. The inspection equipment should be smooth, fresh, user-friendly, and free from sharp edges that could scratch the fabric.
3. **Accessories**: Essential accessories include measuring tape, scissors, defect stickers or chalk, fabric defect display board, reference samples, and blank inspection forms.

### B. Operation, Findings & Actions

1. **Viewing Distance**: Inspectors should maintain a distance of 2 to 3 feet for optimal vision of the full fabric width.
2. **Inspection Speed**: The speed should be adjusted based on the inspector's capability and the nature of the fabric being scrutinized.
3. **Lighting**: Proper lighting is crucial for accurate defect detection and rating.
4. **Inspection Process**: This includes roll selection, proper fabric positioning, and thorough checking for defects and discrepancies.

## The Four Point System

The Four Point System is the most popular and widely used method for fabric inspection due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

### Why the Four Point System is Preferable

1. It's simple to apply, educate, and learn.
2. It's certified by the American Society of Quality Control (ASQC) and the American Apparel Manufacturers (AAMA).
3. It provides a standardized method for assigning penalty points based on defect severity.

### How the Four Point System Works

1. Defects are classified based on their size and severity.
2. Penalty points (1-4) are assigned to each defect.
3. The total points per 100 square yards of fabric are calculated.
4. Fabric with more than 40 points per 100 square yards is considered second quality.

## Conclusion

Implementing a robust fabric inspection process using the FIDAS SOP and the Four Point System can significantly improve quality control in textile manufacturing. By following these guidelines, both fabric mills and garment manufacturers can minimize defects, reduce waste, and ensure higher customer satisfaction.

**OPTIMON SOFTWARE FOR FABRIC CUT OPTIMISATION â€“ LINEAR CUT OPTIMISATION SOFTWARE**

The OPTIMON software is designed to limit production waste and better satisfy customer requests in the textile industry. While our specific experience is focused on fabric cut optimization, the software is suitable for all products that need to be fractioned from a big roll into smaller rolls.

## The Optimization Process

The process typically starts with a certain amount of finished or semi-finished material, where all quality features that can affect the fabric cut are known. These features are detected through visual inspection by human operators or automatic camera-based systems, including all fabric defects, their size and position, as well as other characteristics like shade of color and width.

The optimization software considers all these quality features and the constraints imposed by subsequent processes or final customers.

## Constraints in Fabric Cutting

Constraints can be divided into two main groups:

### 1. Dimensional Constraints
- Each final customer defines minimum and maximum sizes for acceptable rolls
- For rolls made of multiple sewn pieces, each piece must typically have a minimum size

### 2. Qualitative Constraints
- Defects are classified as "acceptable" or "to be cut away"
- "Acceptable" faults are only tolerated within certain limits
- The number of defects or their "demerit points" are considered within a given length of fabric
- Fault concentration and position within the roll are important factors

## Advantages of OPTIMON Software

1. Increased production yield by maximizing first quality fabric and reducing second quality and scrap
2. Ability to preview fragmentation results before physical cutting
3. Opportunity to rework fabric or reassign it to different customers with varying requirements
4. Enhanced focus on production defectivity control and its real impact

## Conclusion

OPTIMON software proves invaluable in making complex cutting decisions that are often impossible for human operators to optimize. By considering multiple factors and constraints, it significantly improves fabric utilization and helps manufacturers meet diverse customer requirements more effectively.
